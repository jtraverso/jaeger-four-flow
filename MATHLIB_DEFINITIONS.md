# Mathlib definitions used by the Jaeger flow statements

Verbatim excerpts of the Mathlib definitions used by the statements in `Challenge.lean`, at the

Challenge can be audited without fetching Mathlib.

## SimpleGraph

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Basic.lean`, line 95:

```lean
/-- A simple graph is an irreflexive symmetric relation `Adj` on a vertex type `V`.
The relation describes which pairs of vertices are adjacent.
There is exactly one edge for every pair of adjacent vertices;
see `SimpleGraph.edgeSet` for the corresponding edge set.

  /-- The adjacency relation of a simple graph. -/

  loopless : Std.Irrefl Adj := by aesop_graph
```

## SimpleGraph.neighborFinset

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Finite.lean`, line 169:

```lean
/-- `G.neighborFinset v` is the `Finset` version of `G.neighborSet v` in case `G` is
locally finite at `v`. -/
def neighborFinset : Finset V :=
  (G.neighborSet v).toFinset
```

## SimpleGraph.degree

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Finite.lean`, line 242:

```lean
/-- `G.degree v` is the number of vertices adjacent to `v`. -/
def degree : ℕ := #(G.neighborFinset v)
```

## SimpleGraph.Dart

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Dart.lean`, line 27:

```lean
/-- A `Dart` is an oriented edge, implemented as an ordered pair of adjacent vertices.
This terminology comes from combinatorial maps, and they are also known as "half-edges"
or "bonds." -/
structure Dart extends V × V where
  adj : G.Adj fst snd
  deriving DecidableEq
```

## SimpleGraph.Dart.symm

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Dart.lean`, line 73:

```lean

@[simps]
def Dart.symm (d : G.Dart) : G.Dart :=
  ⟨d.toProd.swap, d.adj.symm⟩
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Walk/Basic.lean`, line 54:

```lean
/-- A walk is a sequence of adjacent vertices.  For vertices `u v : V`,
the type `walk u v` consists of all walks starting at `u` and ending at `v`.

We say that a walk *visits* the vertices it contains.  The set of vertices a
walk visits is `SimpleGraph.Walk.support`.

See `SimpleGraph.Walk.nil'` and `SimpleGraph.Walk.cons'` for patterns that
can be useful in definitions since they make the vertices explicit. -/

## SimpleGraph.Walk.IsTrail

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Paths.lean`, line 69:

structure IsTrail {u v : V} (p : G.Walk u v) : Prop where
  edges_nodup : p.edges.Nodup
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk.IsCircuit

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Paths.lean`, line 79:

```lean
/-- A *circuit* at `u : V` is a nonempty trail beginning and ending at `u`. -/
@[mk_iff isCircuit_def]
structure IsCircuit {u : V} (p : G.Walk u u) : Prop extends isTrail : IsTrail p where
  ne_nil : p ≠ nil
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk.IsCycle

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Paths.lean`, line 84:

```lean
/-- A *cycle* at `u : V` is a circuit at `u` whose only repeating vertex
is `u` (which appears exactly twice). -/
structure IsCycle {u : V} (p : G.Walk u u) : Prop extends isCircuit : IsCircuit p where
  support_nodup : p.support.tail.Nodup
```

## SimpleGraph.Reachable

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Connectivity/Connected.lean`, line 52:

```lean
/-- Two vertices are *reachable* if there is a walk between them.
This is equivalent to `Relation.ReflTransGen` of `G.Adj`.
See `SimpleGraph.reachable_iff_reflTransGen`. -/
def Reachable (u v : V) : Prop := Nonempty (G.Walk u v)
```

## SimpleGraph.Preconnected

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Connectivity/Connected.lean`, line 228:

```lean
/-- A graph is preconnected if every pair of vertices is reachable from one another. -/
def Preconnected : Prop := ∀ u v : V, G.Reachable u v
```

## SimpleGraph.Connected

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Connectivity/Connected.lean`, line 314:

```lean
/-- A graph is connected if it's preconnected and contains at least one vertex.
This follows the convention observed by mathlib that something is connected iff it has
exactly one connected component.

There is a `CoeFun` instance so that `h u v` can be used instead of `h.Preconnected u v`. -/

## SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic

```

## SimpleGraph.IsTree

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Acyclic.lean`, line 60:

```lean
/-- A *tree* is a connected acyclic graph. -/
@[mk_iff]
structure IsTree : Prop extends
  connected : G.Connected where
  /-- A tree is acyclic. -/

## SimpleGraph.IsEdgeReachable

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Connectivity/EdgeConnectivity.lean`, line 33:

```lean
/-- Two vertices are `k`-edge-reachable if they remain reachable after removing strictly fewer than
`k` edges. -/
def IsEdgeReachable : Prop :=
  ∀ ⦃s : Set (Sym2 V)⦄, s.encard < k → (G.deleteEdges s).Reachable u v
```

## SimpleGraph.IsEdgeConnected

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Connectivity/EdgeConnectivity.lean`, line 38:

```lean
/-- A graph is `k`-edge-connected if any two vertices are `k`-edge-reachable. -/
def IsEdgeConnected : Prop := ∀ u v, G.IsEdgeReachable k u v
```
